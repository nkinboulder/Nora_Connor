# Research
Using network science to evaluate the structure of soil bacterial communities. Using machine learning to evaluate causal inference in political data contexts. 

Paper submitted to PLOS Comp Biol in Summer 2016, came back with major revisions. Due to being on Leave of Absence, paper will be submitted to ISME.

## Publications
*http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/23/070789 (This is the article that will be submitted to ISME)

* I spent my first year taking required core courses for the IQBio program and rotating through three labs for 10 weeks each.  There was essentially no time to work on my own research, which is why the IQBio program provides funding for the first two years of the program.
