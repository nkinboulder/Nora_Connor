# Research

## Publications


* I spent my first year taking required core courses for the IQBio program and rotating through three labs for 10 weeks each.  There was essentially no time to work on my own research, which is why the IQBio program provides funding for the first two years of the program.
* Poster: Genome Size Correlations with Ecological Traits in Bacteria  August 2013 Ecological Society of America meeting, Minneapolis, MN
